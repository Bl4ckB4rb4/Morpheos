# History analizer
#
# This is the main file for this module, where the test cases should be
# developed and where the functions called by the API must be located.
# It depends on several other files, mainly:
#
# fetcher.py    - Uses the browser_history library to actually obtains
#               the histories
# summarize.py  - Collects the data to analyze repetitions and patterns.
#               Its outputs may easily be represented in a histogram
#
# Other files may be added as needed while the development continues
